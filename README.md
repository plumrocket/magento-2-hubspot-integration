* **Leverage the built-in integration with 20+ CRM & email marketing platforms** provided by this Magento Hubspot extension. Seamlessly connect your Magento newsletter popups to HubSpot, Salesforce, Mailchimp, and other accounts to avoid duplicate contacts & save all your customer information in one place.
* **Set multiple triggers for popup display & use conditional logic** to show popups based on customer groups and other attributes. Think of the newsletter popups as a well-tested foundation for your own creativity. So much more than just a popup!
* **Track customer interactions with newsletter popups** and get more useful information about your popups. The extension collects statistics of each popup, tracks how many people viewed your newsletters, how many people clicked on it, how many orders you're getting from the popup, and even how much money you're making!
* **Make sure that collected email addresses are valid.** We compare the email addresses used to subscribe to your list with the black list of disposable email address services. And we don't allow subscribers with email addresses from any of those domains to be included in your contact lists.
